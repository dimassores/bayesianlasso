# bayesianlasso
The bayesian lasso through gibbs sampling presented by Park and Casella (2008)

The code was commented in portuguese. I did the gibbs sampling as the article proposed, and compared it with the traditional lasso on the glmnet package.


The data used is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimassores/bayesianlasso/master/Diabetes.txt).
