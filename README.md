# bayesianlasso
The bayesian lasso through gibbs sampling presented by Park and Casella (2008)

The gibbs sampling was implemented as the article proposed, and compared it with the traditional lasso on the glmnet package in a toy example. 

functions.R has all the functions used and paper_example.R has a example of how to use all functions.

The data used is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimassores/bayesianlasso/master/Diabetes.txt).
